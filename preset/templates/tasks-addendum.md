## Verification labels

<!--
  Added by the Integrated TDD preset. These conventions apply to every task above.
  Keep this section in the generated tasks.md so a reviewer can read the labels.
-->

Every task carries a verification label, placed after the story label and before the
description. The rest of the task line is unchanged.

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `[VO-nnn]` | The task satisfies this obligation from the plan's Verification Plan. Repeat the label for several obligations |
| `[NT: reason]` | The task has no behaviour to verify. The reason is required |

```markdown
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] [VO-001] Write the failing test for an empty cart total in tests/test_cart.py
- [ ] T012 [US1] [VO-001] Implement the cart total in src/cart.py
- [ ] T013 [US1] [NT: README wording only] Document the cart total in README.md
```

A task's kind follows from its labels and its position in this file:

| Kind | Rule |
|------|------|
| `no-test` | Carries `[NT: reason]` and no `[VO-nnn]` |
| `test` | The first task in the file to name a given obligation |
| `behaviour` | Any later task naming that obligation |

- Test tasks are required for every task that delivers behaviour. They are not optional.
- Every obligation needs a `test` task and at least one `behaviour` task, so it is named
  by at least two tasks.
- The first task to name an obligation is its test task whatever its description says, so
  the test task must be written first: the task that writes the failing test comes before
  the task that implements the behaviour.
- A task naming several obligations is a `test` task only when it is the first to name
  all of them.
